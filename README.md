# simple_password_generator

A simple tool for generating passwords :key:

The tool offers to create a randomly generated password between 4 and 128 characters.

The password can be created from symbols, upper case letters, lower case letters and / or numbers.

```
### Simple password generator ###
Choose the length of the password [4-128]: 10
Symbols? [Y/n]: Y
Upper-case letters? [Y/n]: Y
Lower-case letters? [Y/n]: y
Numbers? [Y/n]: n

Password:
YOUR GENERATED PASSWORD
```

### ğŸš§ ğŸš§ ğŸš§ Pending ğŸš§ ğŸš§ ğŸš§

The selected lists currently only build a new list and a random password is generated from this. It is therefore possible that no character from a selected list appears in the password.
